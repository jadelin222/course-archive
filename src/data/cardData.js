      description: "<i>At bottom, the specter is the future, it is always to come, it presents itself only as that which could come or come back.</i> \n in this world nothing is coming back is a VR walking simulator into a deeply personal virtual world of introspection and memory, featuring machine learning generated videos. \n The game oscillates between the haunting presence of the past, the unreliability of memory, and the unsettling uncertainty of the future. While blurring these contingencies into a blender of regrets marked indelibly by personal history, slowly tasting words that are swallowed back, memories eaten by mould, and the bitterness of growing up is unreliably sampled, like the fragmented visions and thoughts that flicker and fade as one drifts to sleep",

In my artwork, I depict fish and objects from the perspective of my unique thoughts and dreams. These thoughts and dreams reside within me like a pot, similar to how nuclear power resides within a single atom, and the reactor can be seen as swaddling clothes. Ultimately, it spirals out of control and explodes…",

Memories of the past rush to her mind—from being born in the stream of blood to being diluted in the stream of information. Regrettably, the loss of love breeds frustration. She ponders, is that a gateway to paradise or merely a narcotic to numb her soul?",

From the ongoing closure of the Israeli Pavilion to the simultaneous demonstration in Venice 2024 and London 2023, not one single individual is left uninvolved in this struggling ocean of voices. These events, along with the Gaza conflict are <i>VOICES</i> no longer, rather both are sounds outside of the Utopian soundscape, an interference threatening to invade. This interference is NOISE, a disturbance in peace; an unfamiliar yet unwanted sound…. The list continues. Under the globalising voicescape, the NOISE disturbance is never a conflict between the values of brightness & darkness, rather a decimation, a struggle of humanity and the freedom of VOICE. \n NOISE manifests disturbance in the space of beliefs, an interruption within a historically unique yet complicated area, a mixture of peace; violence; repression. While remaining simultaneous to the disturbance of NOISE in Gaza, Venice, and London. The speaker audio of the installation is divided into three parts- \n Part 1 is the audio of demonstration in London December 2023, an emotionally powerful protest with a hint of NOISE disturbance. \n Part 2, the audience wears the headphones, and the speaker audio transits to the dark, unrecognisable sound of Part 1 audio, evolving from VOICES of speech to the immoral state of NOISE. \n Part 3 summarises as an explosion audio as the audience places the headphones back, signifying their involvement with the previous NOISE along within the confusion conflict of destruction and disturbance.

In addition to being outside of the bounds of conventional art forms, this project advances our knowledge of emotion and cognition and helps us appreciate the relationship between art and neuroscience on a deeper level.",

The projections shown depict the abstract and stark differences between an orca living freely in the ocean and one trapped in an aquarium. Light is used as a main medium to create an experience that evokes the discomfort experienced by captive orcas. These light projections intertwine with a physical sculpture that mimics the fluid, dynamic forms of orcas in motion, contrasting sharply with the rigid enclosures that represent their confinement. This juxtaposition is not only visual but also thematic, highlighting the unnatural conditions and the palpable tension between freedom and captivity.",
