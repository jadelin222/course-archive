            <p className={styles.workshopDes}>Why do we imagine what we say we imagine? As part of the &apos;Fog Rot&apos; public programme, we will be hosting a &apos;chrono-cartography&apos; workshop exploring themes of forgetting, remembering, ambiguity, and futurity, through a collective imagination activity. Inspired by indie roleplaying games and techniques, the workshop will use group drawing and worldbuilding of abstract timelines to reflect on what emerges when we try to conceptualise the future.

              We will use drawing to additively build up an abstract grid of related temporalities that conceptualise a past, present and future derived from the realities of our own, to collective reflect on our imaginative tendencies to address what is at stake.

              The workshop will feature invited guest participants in the form of artists Johanna de Verdier and Kitty Clark as well as writer and publisher Jamie Sutcliffe, to enrich the conversation and contextualise how relevant themes and stakes emerge within their practices. We feel that their work speaks to the themes and concerns of the workshop and exhibition as a whole and are excited to expand our understanding of practices that respond to the pressing discourses of this age!

                  <p className={styles.guestBio}>Kitty Clark graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art 2011, and lives and works in Hastings and London. 


                    Clark&apos;s practice moves between sculpture and digital media, with many of the works using atypical narrative structures to explore speculative, and frequently dystopian, futures. Themes of escapism and desire, fantasy, science fiction and the esoteric are drawn upon, portrayed with an aesthetic of crooked cartoonish minimalism. Frequently her work utilises devices and structures found in gaming, from choose-your-own-adventure books to text based RPGs.

                <h3 className={styles.guestName}>Johanna De Verdier</h3>
                <p className={styles.guestBio}>Johanna de Verdier is an artist working primarily across sculpture, installation and performance often along with computational, sensory components. By looking into the possibilities of self-sufficient ways of living she explores the consequences of extractive industries and what the resurgence of local and rural knowledge might look like in a world that has already gone through climate collapse. 

                  Her work often takes shape as tools, backpacks and instruments - a practical array of vessels and instruments for biological survival in post-apocalyptic scenarios. Drawing inspiration from makeshift building structures, preppers, folklore, magic and feminist technoculture Johanna's practice takes a speculative approach to the idea of the apocalypse, linking “the end” to utopian politics, ecology and collectivity.
